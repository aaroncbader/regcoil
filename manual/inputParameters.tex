\section{General parameters}

\param{transfer\_matrix\_option}
{integer}
{1}
{Always}
{Which method is used to compute the transfer matrix.\\

{\ttfamily transfer\_matrix\_option} = 1: 3-surface approach: parameterize the solutions to Laplace's equation using a surface current on an outer surface
which is outside the control surface.\\

{\ttfamily transfer\_matrix\_option} = 2: 2-surface approach: parameterize the solutions to Laplace's equation using monopoles on the control surface. In this case
all parameters associated with the outer surface are changed to match the middle surface.
}

\myhrule

\param{symmetry\_option}
{integer}
{1}
{Always}
{Determines which set of basis functions is used.\\

{\ttfamily symmetry\_option} = 1: Use $\sin(2 \pi [mu+nv])$ basis functions.\\

{\ttfamily symmetry\_option} = 2: Use $\cos(2 \pi [mu+nv])$ basis functions.\\

{\ttfamily symmetry\_option} = 3: Use both $\sin(2 \pi [mu+nv])$ and $\cos(2 \pi [mu+nv])$ basis functions.

\myhrule

\param{basis\_option\_plasma}

This option controls only the plasma surface. Analogous options {\ttfamily basis\_option\_middle} and {\ttfamily basis\_option\_outer}
exist for the other two surfaces.\\

{\ttfamily basis\_option\_plasma} = 1: Use $w = 1 / (n_p |\vect{N}|)$, so the basis functions
are the Fourier functions $\sqrt{2} \sin(2\pi[mu+nv])$ and/or $\sqrt{2} \cos(2\pi[mu+nv])$ (
as determined by \parlink{symmetry\_option}).\\

{\ttfamily basis\_option\_plasma} = 2: Use a constant weight, $w = 1/A$ where $A$ is the surface area. The basis functions
will be Fourier functions scaled by $\sqrt{2A/[n_p |\vect{N}|]}$.\\

{\ttfamily basis\_option\_plasma} = 3: Use a constant weight, $w = 1/A$. The basis functions
will be linear combinations of the Fourier functions, as constructed using the Cholesky method.

\param{pseudoinverse\_thresholds}
{real array}
{1e-12}

{To form the pseudoinverse of the outer-to-middle inductance matrix, singular values larger than this threshold
will be replaced by their inverse, whereas singular values smaller than this threshold will be replaced by zero.
You can supply more than one threshold value in order to compare results for different choices.
Good threshold values are in the range 1e-6 to 1e-13, i.e. small compared to 1 but larger than machine precision.}

$T = U\Sigma V^{T}$.
Regardless of this parameter, all singular \emph{values} will be saved in the output file.}

\myhrule

\param{save\_level}
{integer}
{3}
{Always}

{\ttfamily save\_level} = 3: Also do not save the {\ttfamily drdu}, {\ttfamily drdv}, and {\ttfamily normal} arrays.\\

{\ttfamily save\_level} = 4: Also do not save the singular vectors as functions of $(u,v)$. The vectors
will still be saved as amplitudes of basis functions.
}

\myhrule

\param{zero\_first\_transfer\_vector\_in\_overlap}
{logical}
{\false}
{Always}
{A tool for determining which axis of the {\ttfamily overlap\_plasma} and {\ttfamily overlap\_middle}
matrices corresponds to the transfer matrix versus the plasma-middle inductance matrix.
When this parameter is true, the first column (i.e. first singular vector) in both $\vect{U}$
and $\vect{V}$ for the transfer matrix SVD are set to 0 before computing the overlap matrices.
}

\myhrule

\param{net\_poloidal\_current\_Amperes}
{real}
{1.0}
{If \parlink{geometry\_option\_plasma}=0,1,or 5, i.e. if the plasma surface is not a vmec equilibrium.}
{The number of Amperes of current the links the middle surface toroidally. This
number is used to set the overall magnitude of the normal fields due to a $1/R$ external
field or due to constant-$v$ coils. If the plasma surface is obtained from a vmec equilibrium,
then {\ttfamily net\_poloidal\_current\_Amperes} will be determined instead
from the {\ttfamily bvco} value in the vmec wout file.

\section{Resolution parameters}

For any new set of surface geometries you consider, you should vary the resolution parameters in this section to make sure
they are large enough.  These parameters should be large enough that the code results you care about are unchanged under further
resolution increases.
